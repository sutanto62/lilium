Hi team,

Following up on **Abhishek's excellent suggestion** regarding demo plot monitoring capabilities, I've completed the initial PR/FAQ document outlining this feature for our Plantation Management System.

## Background

Abhishek identified a key opportunity: our existing partners, particularly estate owners collaborating with SawitPRO, are already conducting agricultural trials but lack systematic tools to track and analyze results. This creates significant friction in validating new cultivation methods and scaling successful innovations.

## Business Value

This feature directly addresses the needs of partners like:

- **Abdul Haris Plantation** (contact: Becquini Akbar) - Currently running demo plots with SawitPRO
- Other estates testing new fertilizers, harvesting techniques, or pest management strategies

Rather than tracking experiments in spreadsheets or paper logs, these partners would gain:
- Centralized data collection and comparison dashboards
- Statistical validation of trial results
- ROI analysis to justify scaling successful methods
- Photo documentation and progress tracking
- Shareable reports for agronomist collaboration

## What I've Prepared

I've created a comprehensive PR/FAQ document (see `docs/PR-FAQ-Demo-Plot-Monitoring.md`) that covers:
- Press release positioning the value proposition
- 30+ FAQs covering setup, data collection, analytics, and best practices
- Technical and business considerations

## Proposed Next Steps

1. **Validation Call** - Schedule a discussion with Becquini Akbar (Abdul Haris Plantation) to validate assumptions and gather specific requirements from their current demo plot practices
   
2. **Technical Scoping** - Engineering team reviews the PR/FAQ to assess feasibility, integration points, and effort estimate

3. **Pilot Planning** - If approved, design a pilot program with 2-3 existing SawitPRO partners who are actively running trials

4. **Design Mockups** - UX team creates wireframes for key workflows (plot creation, data entry, comparison dashboards)

## Questions for Discussion

- Should we prioritize this over other roadmap items?
- What's our timeline target if we proceed?
- Are there other partners beyond Abdul Haris Plantation who would be early adopters?
- Should we explore partnerships with agricultural research institutes?

**Credit where it's due:** Thank you to **Abhishek** for surfacing this opportunity and connecting it to real partner needs.

Happy to discuss further. Would love to get your feedback on the PR/FAQ and whether we should proceed with validation calls.

Best regards,
