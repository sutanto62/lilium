# Cursor Rules for Conventional Commits

## Git Commit Message Format

Always use conventional commit format for all git commits:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit Types

Use these types for commit messages:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit

### Scope (Optional)

Use scope to indicate which part of the codebase is affected:
- `api`: Backend API changes
- `ui`: Frontend UI changes
- `auth`: Authentication related changes
- `db`: Database changes
- `test`: Testing related changes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `deploy`: Deployment related changes

### Description

- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No dot (.) at the end
- Keep it under 72 characters

### Examples

Good commit messages:
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 authentication with Google
fix(ui): resolve navigation menu alignment issue
docs: update README with installation instructions
refactor(api): simplify user service logic
test: add unit tests for EventService
chore: update dependencies to latest versions
```

Bad commit messages:
```
fixed bug
updated code
WIP
quick fix
```

### Breaking Changes

For breaking changes, add `!` after type/scope and include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer:

```
feat(api)!: change user endpoint response format

BREAKING CHANGE: The /api/users endpoint now returns user data in a different structure
```

### Commit Message Guidelines

1. **Be specific**: Describe what the commit does, not just what you changed
2. **Use present tense**: "add feature" not "added feature"
3. **Be concise**: Keep the description under 72 characters
4. **Use body for details**: If you need more explanation, use the commit body
5. **Reference issues**: If fixing an issue, reference it in the footer: `Fixes #123`

### When Writing Code

- Follow the conventional commit format when suggesting commit messages
- Ensure commit messages are descriptive and follow the established pattern
- Consider the scope when the change affects specific parts of the codebase
- Use appropriate type based on the nature of the change
