Hey team,

Following up on last week's Plantation Services discussion regarding Demo Plot. I'm thinking of developing a feature on top of KebunPRO. 

## Quick Context

It's not something new in plantation systems - this kind of tool is usually being provided to Agronomists. But here's the thing: **Abhishek set up SawitPRO 3.0 for fertilizer distribution as a solid foundation to provide this tool for customers**, particularly helping estate owners who are already doing demo plots anyway.

## Why This Makes Sense Now

We've got partners like **Abdul Haris Plantation** (Becquini Akbar) who are already collaborating with SawitPRO on demo plots. Right now they're probably tracking everything manually or in spreadsheets. 

With this feature, they'd get:
- Easy data collection and side-by-side comparisons
- Clear results on what's working vs what's not
- ROI calculations to justify rolling out new methods
- Photo tracking and progress timelines
- Reports they can share with their agronomists

## What I've Put Together

I've drafted a PR/FAQ document (attached - see `docs/PR-FAQ-Demo-Plot-Monitoring.md`) that lays out:
- The problem we're solving and how this helps
- 30+ FAQs covering everything from setup to analytics
- Business value and technical considerations

## Next Steps (If We Want to Move Forward)

1. **Chat with Becquini** - Get his input on what Abdul Haris Plantation actually needs for their demo plots. Validate we're solving the right problem.
   
2. **Tech Review** - Have the engineering team take a look and tell us if this is feasible and how much work we're talking about.

3. **Pilot Program** - If it looks good, maybe run a pilot with 2-3 partners who are already doing demo plots.

4. **Mock Things Up** - Get some basic wireframes going for key screens (creating plots, logging data, viewing comparisons).

## Questions to Think About

- Does this fit our roadmap priorities right now?
- What kind of timeline are we looking at?
- Who else besides Abdul Haris Plantation would benefit from this?
- Any other SawitPRO partners we should loop in?

Anyway, wanted to share the progress. Let me know your thoughts on the PR/FAQ and if we should take the next step with customer validation.

Thanks,
